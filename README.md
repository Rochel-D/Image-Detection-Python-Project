# Image Detection Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform image detection using Python. The goal is to detect and classify objects in images using a pre-trained deep learning model.

## Features
- Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
- Uses pre-trained models for high accuracy.
- Outputs labeled images and detection confidence scores.
- Easy-to-configure settings for batch or single-image processing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries:
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose your preferred deep learning framework)
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
